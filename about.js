Today, memory — the act of affirming the past and quoting fragments of our lives — has become a construct, one that we can artificially shape or alter. This subject deeply concerns me, especially in the context of the digitalized world, where the function of memory is increasingly delegated to machines — machines that are ultimately controlled by individuals, corporations, or business interests.

beyond the political and social dimensions, memory on a personal level is a fragile and highly plastic phenomenon. When we live through trauma, leaving vivid stains in our internal archive, we gradually lose the ability to say with certainty that the images we recall are indeed the reality that once was.`;
